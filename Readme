Created repository with some elementary data sets that can be called
by 2J03 students using code downloaded from this site.

Data is served up by GitHub Pages (e.g.,
https://jeffreyracine.github.io/2J03/death.dat), while the repository
can be browsed at https://github.com/JeffreyRacine/2J03

Note: Either a) download the R file and open it in RStudio (it will be
opened in the editor where you can 'run' or 'source'), OR b) start a
new R script in the editor (from the menu File -> New File -> R
Script) THEN copy the code from GitHub directly into the editor and
save the file (will intitially be named 'Untitled.R') to something
with a more helpful name.
